  <h1>About CAP Technologies</h1>
  <p>
    CAP Technologies is a small, developer-driven group focused on practical hardware and software projects.
    Our work combines hands-on experimentation with a solid understanding of computing fundamentals, allowing
    us to build tools that are simple, reliable, and genuinely useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    We work across both hardware and software, exploring how systems behave, how they break, and how they can
    be improved. Whether we’re testing Linux environments, designing internal utilities, or refining our web
    infrastructure, our goal is to create clear, well-documented solutions that anyone can learn from.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Work On</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>System Testing &amp; Diagnostics:</strong>
      Experiments and tools that explore how operating systems respond under different conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hardware-Aware Development:</strong>
      Projects that consider the interaction between software and the machines it runs on.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Web &amp; Software Tools:</strong>
      Lightweight applications and components that support our online presence and internal workflows.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Build</h2>
  <p>We keep things straightforward:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Focus on clarity and simplicity</li>
    <li>Document everything</li>
    <li>Build tools that solve real problems</li>
    <li>Improve through experimentation</li>
    <li>Keep projects lightweight and maintainable</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Direction</h2>
  <p>
    CAP Technologies is steadily growing its collection of tools and documentation. As we continue to explore
    new ideas across hardware and software, our aim is to build a library of practical, well-engineered
    resources for developers, learners, and anyone curious about how technology really works.
